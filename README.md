# Liblinear-Ruby
[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/liblinear-ruby.png)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/liblinear-ruby)

Liblinear-Ruby is Ruby interface of LIBLINEAR using SWIG.
Now, this interface is supporting LIBLINEAR 2.30.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'liblinear-ruby'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install liblinear-ruby

## Quick Start
This sample code execute classification with L2-regularized logistic regression.
```ruby
require 'liblinear'

# train
model = Liblinear.train(
  { solver_type: Liblinear::L2R_LR },   # parameter
  [-1, -1, 1, 1],                       # labels (classes) of training data
  [[-2, -2], [-1, -1], [1, 1], [2, 2]], # training data
)
# predict
puts Liblinear.predict(model, [0.5, 0.5]) # predicted class will be 1
```

## Parameter
There are some parameters you can specify:

- `solver_type`
- `cost`
- `sensitive_loss`
- `epsilon`
- `weight_labels` and `weights`

### solver_type
This parameter specifies a type of solver (default: `Liblinear::L2R_L2LOSS_SVC_DUAL`).  
This corresponds to `-s` option on command line.  
Solver types you can set are shown below:  
```ruby
# for multi-class classification
Liblinear::L2R_LR              # L2-regularized logistic regression (primal)
Liblinear::L2R_L2LOSS_SVC_DUAL # L2-regularized L2-loss support vector classification (dual)
Liblinear::L2R_L2LOSS_SVC      # L2-regularized L2-loss support vector classification (primal)
Liblinear::L2R_L1LOSS_SVC_DUAL # L2-regularized L1-loss support vector classification (dual)
Liblinear::MCSVM_CS            # support vector classification by Crammer and Singer
Liblinear::L1R_L2LOSS_SVC      # L1-regularized L2-loss support vector classification
Liblinear::L1R_LR              # L1-regularized logistic regression
Liblinear::L2R_LR_DUAL         # L2-regularized logistic regression (dual)

# for regression
Liblinear::L2R_L2LOSS_SVR      # L2-regularized L2-loss support vector regression (primal)
Liblinear::L2R_L2LOSS_SVR_DUAL # L2-regularized L2-loss support vector regression (dual)
Liblinear::L2R_L1LOSS_SVR_DUAL # L2-regularized L1-loss support vector regression (dual)
```

### cost
This parameter specifies the cost of constraints violation (default `1.0`).  
This corresponds to `-c` option on command line.

### sensitive_loss
This parameter specifies an epsilon in loss function of epsilon-SVR (default `0.1`).  
This corresponds to `-p` option on command line.   

### epsilon
This parameter specifies a tolerance of termination criterion.  
This corresponds to `-e` option on command line.  
The default value depends on a type of solver. See LIBLINEAR's README or `Liblinear::Parameter.default_epsion` for more details.

### weight_labels and weights
These parameters are used to change the penalty for some classes (default `[]`).  
Each `weights[i]` corresponds to `weight_labels[i]`, meaning that the penalty of class `weight_labels[i]` is scaled by a factor of `weights[i]`.  


## Train
First, prepare training data.  

```ruby
# Define class of each training data:
labels = [1, -1, ...]

# Training data is Array of Array:
examples = [
  [1, 0, 0, 1, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 1],
  ...
]

# You can also use Array of Hash instead:
examples = [
  { 1 => 1, 4 => 1 },
  { 4 => 1, 5 => 1 },
  ...
]
```

Next, set the bias (this corresponds to `-B` option on command line):
```ruby
bias = 0.5 # default -1
```

Then, specify parameters and execute `Liblinear.train` to get the instance of `Liblinear::Model`.
```ruby
model = Liblinear.train(parameter, labels, examples, bias)
```

In this phase, you can save model as:
```ruby
model.save(file_name)
```

If you have already had a model file, you can load it as:
```ruby
model = Liblinear::Model.load(file_name)
```

## Feature Weights
To get the feature weights of the model.

```ruby
model.feature_weights
```

## Predict
Prepare the data you want to predict its class and call `Liblinear.predict`.

```ruby
examples = [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
Liblinear.predict(model, example)
```

## Cross Validation
To get classes predicted by k-fold cross validation, use `Liblinear.cross_validation`.  
For example, `results[0]` is a class predicted by `examples` excepts part including `examples[0]`.
```ruby
results = Liblinear.cross_validation(fold, parameter, labels, examples)
```

## Quiet / Verbose Mode
You can supress output while executing `Liblinear::Model.train`.
```ruby
# Output is supressed by:
Liblinear.quiet_mode

# You can undo by:
Liblinear.verbose_mode
```
